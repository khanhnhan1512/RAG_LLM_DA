# Usage Guide:
- Step 1: Open Visual Studio Code and open the folder containing the thesis source code.
- Step 2: Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code and activate the virtual environment created during installation:
    + Run the command: conda activate RAG_LLM-env
- Step 3: Run the model stages using the following command:
    + Run the command: python main.py -d <dataset name>. Example: python main.py -d icews14
- Step 4: The results of each stage will be saved in the "result/<dataset name>" folder. The model has 5 stages, so there will be 5 result folders corresponding to each stage.
You can view the results of each stage in the .json, .csv, or txt files in these folders. The final results containing evaluation metrics (hit@k, MRR) will be in the file "result/<dataset name>/stage_5/result_eval.txt".

This is the complete usage guide to run the model. If you encounter any issues during usage, please contact the authors via email: nknhan21@clc.fitus.edu.vn or dnthang21@clc.fitus.edu.vn
